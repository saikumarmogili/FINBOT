However, the case was closed without warning, and the funds were released to XXXX on or around XXXX XXXXbefore the dispute deadline and without my approval. I was not given any opportunity to escalate. The XXXX interface was unclear and inaccessible, offering no step-by-step guidance or confirmation. As someone who is XXXX, I relied on screen readers and assumed that once the seller failed to respond, the system would escalate automatically. It did not. \\n\\nI contacted XXXX XXXX to request clarification. They later mailed me a decision letternot in an accessible format, and when I called to ask what it said, they refused to read or explain it. I was therefore denied access to the outcome of my own financial dispute. My card provider rejected the chargeback, relying solely on XXXX flawed process and ignoring the evidence I submitted, including screenshots, communication threads, and XXXX contradictory policies. \\n\\nI am now out {$570.00} and was never given a meaningful opportunity to respond, understand my rights, or access a resolution system designed for my needs. I am requesting that XXXX XXXX reopen the chargeback and that XXXX be investigated for releasing funds during an open dispute window, in violation of buyer protection expectations.
